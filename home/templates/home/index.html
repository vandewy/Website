    <h1>About:</h1>
    <div>
    <p>I have been an Air Traffic controller for the past 10 years; rated as a RAPCON controller
        as well as a Certified Tower Controller for the United States Air Force in Texas and Alaska.
        I have also spent 4 years as an Air Traffic Control instructor, teaching the
        fundamentals of FAA and USAF rules and regulations via lecture as well as in a simulated
        environment.  As an instructor I also taught the Standard Terminal Automations
        Replacement System (STARS) course.  This course include basic system admin responsibilies
        in a Unix (Solaris 10) environment and the use of security software such as NISPlus and
        the Basic Security Module for auditing.

        I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science; I have since found myself spending most of my free time
        working on software projects, particularly in the area of air traffic control simulations using
        the Unity game engine
